# Notes and Topic Papers

After a suggestion from my advisor, Dr. Alexanderian, I've decided to maintain
a small repository of notes and topic papers I've written over the course of my
education and research. These are occasionally revisited and updated, and should
there be any quesitons, comments, or corrections you have regarding these,
please feel free to email me at my \*.edu email.

## Topic Papers

- [Parareal: A Parallel-in-time integrator](./resources/Parareal/Parareal.pdf)
- [HOGWILD!:](./resources/Hogwild.pdf)
