# Notes and Topic Papers

After a suggestion from my advisor, I've decided to maintain a small repository
of notes and topic papers I've written over the course of my education and
research. These are occasionally revisited and updated, and should there be any
quesitons, comments, or corrections you have regarding these, please feel free
to email me at my \*.edu email.

## Topic Papers

- [Parareal: A Parallel-in-Time Integrator](/storage/Parareal/Parareal.pdf)
- [HOGWILD!: A Lock-Free Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent](/storage/Hogwild.pdf)
