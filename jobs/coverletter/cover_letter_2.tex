\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}

I am writing this cover letter as an introduction for my application for the
position of \textit{Software Engineer in Test Intern for Numerical Algorithms}
at your company of Mathworks.

Mathworks work on Matlab has been something I've spent a significant amount of
my academic career working with. I remember in my freshman year, when
implementing a QR iteration for my numerical computation class, I found out that
Matlab ran the same code in minutes, rather than the hours taken by Octave. I
realized that this difference was coming from the bottleneck in the actual QR
factorization; but I couldn't see what black magic you used to achieve this. To
this day I'm still interested in how you guys managed to get it to perform at
that level, and if I start in this position, I hope to help create performant
algorithms like that. I've spent lots of my academic career studying numerical
methods, from taking the PhD numerical methods seminars, to applying it in a
Geometric Modeling or Algebraic Number Theoretical context. By using the theory
I gained here I hope to help as much as I can. 

If you are interested, please send me an email at abhijit9331@gmail.com, or a
call to (240) 715-8308. Finally, thank you for taking the time to review my
application, have a good day. \\

Sincerely yours, 
\usekomavar{signature}.
