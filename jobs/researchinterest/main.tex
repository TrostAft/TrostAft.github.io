\section{Introduction}

I'm largely interested in Computational Mathematics, specficially regarding the
algorithms and analysis of them. Therefore, some fields that I find interesting
are numerical linear algebra, computational group theory, fast PDE/ODE solvers,
etc. In addition, I have a substantial interest in the methods used to
accomplish such tasks, such as compilers and high performance computing. Most
have my study has gone to the study of such topics, and most of my projects are
directly related.

I've had a breadth type of study, and have hit most of the fields that can be
modeled by a computer. Ideally, I would like to work on projects similar to
FLINT \footnote{Fast Library for Number Theory: http://www.flintlib.org/},
LinBox \footnote{Exact computational linear algebra: http://www.linalg.org/}, or
SageMath \footnote{Symbolic Everything: http://www.sagemath.org/}, but am also
very interested in the related pure fields, though I will likely take a
computational bent to the project.

\section{Projects}

To give you a better idea of what I've done so far, here's a few applications.

\subsection{Algebraic Point Set Surfaces}

During the Spring 2018 semester, my sophomore year, I took this course called
Geometric Modeling. This was a masters/PhD level course, intended for those
interested in computer graphics research or cutting edge level industry work,
and I attended on reccomendation from a professor who thought the coursework was
wild. While the whole class was a beautiful exercise in Numerical Optimization
and Numerical Linear Algebra, my term project is currently a main motivation for
me to pursue research in this field.

My final project was to implement the paper \textit{Algebraic Point Set
Surfaces} by Gunnebaud and Gross. Roughly speaking, in geometric modeling the
pipeline: Physical object $\to$ spatial point cloud representing external
surface $\to$ triangularized mesh representing object. The paper focused on a
fast method to take the point cloud to a triangularized mesh. The prevailing
method was to consider an open neighborhood of a point in the cloud, and fit a
plane to it that minimized the distance to the points in that neighborhood. Such
a plane would become part of the later mesh. The paper suggested fitting a
sphere to these points instead, which was hugely advantageous in regions of high
curvature. Such a fit would result in a non-linear optimization, but the key
idea of using the algebraic definition of a sphere, results in a nicer
computation. Specifically, given normals we can have a linear system solve,
and we can estimate them with a generalized eigenproblem.

The truly difficult parts of this project to me wasn't the actual graphics
theory. What really plagued me was the implementation; I ran into serious
runtime issues in the actual construction of the matrices involved in the
eigenproblem, and later the linear system solve. I spent a while making various
vectorization arguments to speed up the construction, and then later making
sparsity arguments in the actual system solve. 

Despite the difficulty of my first research level project, I truly enjoyed the
construction process, nothing to say of the relief when I finally managed to
triangularize a bunny \footnote{A classic point cloud to construct is the
Stanford Bunny model.}. In addition, it verified to me that I not only enjoyed
the study of numerical methods, but liked and was capable of research and
development in them.

\subsection{FFPoly}

This is a new project I've begun, and have taken into my semester as a project.
In my graduate algebra course I was exposed to some algebraic number theory, and
upon request, my professor showed me a few papers regarding the computational
aspects of it. Intrigued, I decided to write a module in C\textit{++}
implementing a element of the field $\mathbb{F}_p[x]$, for small $p \in
\mathbb{Z}$. 

This polynomial field is interesting, since the splitting behavior of minimal 
polynomials of number fields gives information of the splitting behavior of the
corresponding primes in the algebraic number field. Furthermore, using
Minkowski's bound, we could said information to verify the class groups of
certain small quadratic number fields, which is interesting. SageMath has such a
capability, but I had a couple of special ideas that I wanted to try;
specifically I wanted to investigate the performance of parallelization on these
problems. I'm taking a PhD course in High Performance Computing now, and plan on
using this project as my capstone research piece. There is lots of potential in
the field operations and factoring steps.

This project is in it's infantile stages, and I've just barely began learning
OpenMP, but since parallel computation is a future step in numerical methods, I
have high hopes for its results.
