## Activities and Projects

- Math REU @ Ohio University with [Qiliang Wu](https://sites.google.com/view/qwu/).
  - We researched the Nonlinear Stability of the Swift-Hohenberg equation at the
    Zigzag boundary. My main contributions were in:
    - (Very painstakingly!) Correcting an error in the coefficients of the
      critical eigenvalue of the
        linearized spectral problem of the 2D Swift Hohenberg equation, as
        originally found in [(Mielke
        96)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002200050230) and
        extending said coefficients to a higher level of accuracy.
    - Working out and proving the $L^1-L^\infty$ bounds of the nonlinear terms
        of our Split Swift-Hohenberg equation.
    - Putting together the final details of the contraction argument to prove
        nonlinear diffusivity.
  - We managed to prove the result, paper still in draft stages.
  - Presented by Qiliang at Miami Universities' Forty-Seventh Annual Conference
    in Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems and their Applications.
