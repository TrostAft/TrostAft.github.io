## About Me
- Ph.D. student in Applied (Computational) Math at NCSU.
- Research interests in the theory and practice of computational mathematics,
  with emphasis on scalable methods (parallelization, randomized approaches,
  distributed algorithms, etc). Certainly not against little theory of PDE and
  nonlinear dynamical systems here and there.
- Hobbies:
  - Computer hardware and Linux enthusiast.
  - A fan of ancient Roman poetry (particularily Ovid).
  - Likes high fantasy and xianxia novels.
- Not great at web design (sorry).
