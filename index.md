## About Me

- 2nd year Ph.D. student in Applied Math at NCSU.
  - Advisor: [Dr. Alen Alexanderian](https://aalexan3.math.ncsu.edu/)
- BA in Math and Computer Science with minor in Classical Studies at NYU.

## Research Interests

In general, I'm interested in the theory and practice of computational math with
emphasis on scalable methods, e.g.
  - Parallelization
  - GPU acceleration
  - Randomzied approaches

Recently I've been working on methods for
- Inverse problems
- PDE-constrained optimization
- Optimal experimental design
- Uncertainty quantification for the above

## Misc
- Hobbies:
  - Computer hardware and GNU/Linux.
  - Ancient Roman poetry (particularily Ovid's exile writings).
  - High fantasy and xianxia novels.
- Not great at web design (sorry).
