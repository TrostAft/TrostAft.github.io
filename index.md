## About Me
- Math and CS guy
- Research interests in Computational Math.
- Not great at web design (sorry)

## Activities and Projects

- Math REU @ Ohio University with [Qiliang Wu](https://sites.google.com/view/qwu/).
  - We researched the Nonlinear Stability of the Swift-Hohenberg equation at the
    Zigzag boundary.
  - We managed to prove the result, paper still in draft stages.
  - Presented by Qiliang at Miami Universities' Forty-Seventh Annual Conference
    in Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems and their Applications.
