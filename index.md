## About Me

- 2nd year Ph.D. student in Applied Math at NCSU.
  - Advisor: [Dr. Alen Alexanderian](https://aalexan3.math.ncsu.edu/)
- BA in Math and Computer Science with minor in Classical Studies at NYU.

## Research Interests

In general, I'm interested in the theory and practice of computational math. Recently, that has
brought me to the randomized numerical analysis group here at NCSU, working on ideas for:
- Inverse problems
- PDE-constrained optimization
- Optimal experimental design
- Uncertainty quantification for the above

## Misc
- Hobbies:
  - Computer hardware and GNU/Linux.
  - Ancient Roman poetry (particularily Ovid's exile writings).
  - High fantasy and xianxia novels.
  - eSports (Dota 2 currently consuming me)
- Not great at web design (sorry).
