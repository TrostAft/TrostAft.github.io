## About Me
- 2nd year Ph.D. student in Applied Math at NCSU.
- Research interests in the theory and practice of computational mathematics,
  with emphasis on scalable methods (parallelization, randomized approaches,
  GPU acceleration, etc). Currently focused on computational inverse problems,
  typically from a Bayesian perspective.
- Hobbies:
  - Computer hardware and GNU/Linux.
  - Ancient Roman poetry (particularily Ovid's exile writings).
  - High fantasy and xianxia novels.
- Not great at web design (sorry).
