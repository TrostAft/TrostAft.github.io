## About Me
- Math and CS guy
- Research interests in Computational Math.
- Not great at web design (sorry)

## Activities and Projects

- The summer of 2019 I spent at Ohio University in a math REU under professor
    Qiliang Wu, where we researched the nonlinear stability of the
    Swift-Hohenberg equation, resulting in a paper (currently in the draft
    stages).
- Math REU @ Ohio University
  - Worked with [Qiliang Wu](https://sites.google.com/view/qwu/).
  - We researched the Nonlinear Stability of the Swift-Hohenberg equation at the
    Zigzag boundary.
  - We managed to prove the result, paper still in draft stages.
