## About Me
- Currently an Undergraduate student at NYU: Math and CS major, Classics Minor.
- Beginning a PhD in Applied (Computational) Math at NCSU in Fall 2020.
- Research interests in the theory and practice of computational mathematics,
  with emphasis on scalable methods (parallelization, randomized approaches,
  distributed algorithms, etc). Certainly not against little theory of PDE and
  nonlinear dynamical systems here and there.
- Not great at web design (sorry).
