title: "Central Limit Theorem through Random Walks"

The central limit theorem is a beautiful result I recently learned about in my
probability course, and I thought a beautiful application of it can be seen in
random walks! First, the theorem:

*Theorem:* Let $\{X_1, \dots, X_n\}$ be a sequence of idependent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) random variables such that $\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \mu, Var(X_i)
= \sigma^2$.
