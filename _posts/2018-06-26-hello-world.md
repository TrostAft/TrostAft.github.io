Looks like I finally got a blog up and running, equipped with math working. 

$$
\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L \iff \forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 :
d(x,c) < \delta \implies d(f(x),L) < \varepsilon
$$

Nice! I can't tell you how long that took me, for something that turned out to
be embarressingly easy. I have no idea how I'm going to get latex packages in
here.
